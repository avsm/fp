Notes on using the framework:

. Test input files have the .fd extension.

. The compiler is called with the -test option for the tests.

. The compiler's output to both stdout and stderr is captured into a
  .out file.

. The compiler's expected output should be put in a file with the
  corresponding rootname and a .ext extension.

. If the test is supposed to succeed without any output, there is no
  need to add a .ext file.
