TODO:

- Lib: Handcode pcap -> ethernet -> ipv4 -> tcp using fp_lib.

- Ott: Use a Map kind for case fields.

- Ott: Handle nested structs.  We need to specify an appropriate
  environment namespace mechanism to handle variable lookups for
  nested structs.


Notes:

- Each datatype is viewed as an interpretation of a view of a
  bytestream.

- To implement this: make all representation types for the viewtype
  modules the view, not the evaluation type.  The evaluation type
  needs to also be exported in the module signature, to implement
  array functors (see below).

- The array datatype should be implemented as a functor, that takes as
  an argument the module for a primitive datatype.  Note that arrays
  of arrays will probably not trivially work with this approach.

- The representation type of a dependent sum will be an object of a
  class whose constructor will take as arguments the implementation
  views of each label.

- To implement array element updates, the lower-level modules
  implementing each element need to be updatable.  This means given an
  object bound to a view, we need a way of getting a new object with
  the same contents bound to a different view.  This is implemented as
  an object-level copy function, that given a view, marshals the
  object's contents into that view, and returns a new object bound to
  that view.  This copy function handles endianess differences between
  the source and dest environments.

- Lib: We should handle errors that arise when unmarshalling beyond
  the limit of the buffer by throwing an appropriate exception.  This
  way, the user can retry with a bigger buffer.
